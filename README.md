# top100citedAI
network visualization and semantic analysis on top 100 paper on AI

From OpenAlex download top 100 most cited paper, field Social Science, Language English, type articles. Export in csv. Total amount of records: 104.
Run analisi_articoli_ai or analisi_articoli_ai_pathfix
results are keys_network.csv and word_net.csv + Figure 1 (number of articles per year).
Using keys_network, run one of the network_visualization file. results should show a static network and one in html. Major bugs in visualization still persist.
Using word_net, similar network should show up, running word network visualization. It doesn't work at the moment.
